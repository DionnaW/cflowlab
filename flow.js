//info given: plants double in number every week;  plants are contained is circular, with a radius of 5 meters;  formula for calculating the area of a circle is PI multiplied by the radius
//area of the space is
const Pl = 3.1415;
const radius = 5
const startingArea = Pl * radius * radius;
console.log(startingArea);

//the mathmathical total radius of the starting area is 78.537 sq.ft.
//now will calc the num of plants that will fit in current area, will use space req per plant
